# Book Text Analysis (Python)

This project analyzes the content of a book using Python to extract meaningful insights from raw text data.

## Overview
The notebook reads a full book text file, preprocesses the content, and performs exploratory text analysis to understand patterns such as word frequency and structure.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Text file processing
- Basic data analysis

## Files
- `Book_analysis.ipynb` – Main notebook containing the analysis
- `miracle_in_the_andes.txt` – Source text used for analysis
- `Untitled.ipynb` – Additional experimentation notebook

## Usage
1. Open the notebook
2. Run the cells to perform the analysis on the text file.

## Learning Outcome
This project demonstrates practical text preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and working with large unstructured text files in Python.
